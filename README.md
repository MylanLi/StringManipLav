Got nostalgic about an example program i whipped up while teaching yr12 SoftDev

Actual code in Form1.vb

Written in Visual Basic which was the language the previous teacher used with the class.
Looking back, maybe teaching something Python would've taught the students a bit more. Maybe not though since it was a subject about the software development lifecycle.
